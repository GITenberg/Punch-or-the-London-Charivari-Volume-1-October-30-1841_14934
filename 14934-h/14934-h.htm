<h2>THE GREAT CREATURE.</h2>
<p>That &ldquo;great creature,&rdquo; like some other &ldquo;great
creatures,&rdquo; happened, as almanacs say, &ldquo;about this
time&rdquo; to be somewhat &ldquo;out at elbows;&rdquo;&mdash;not
in the way of costume, for the very plenitude of his wardrobe was
the cause which produced this effect, inasmuch as the word
&ldquo;received&rdquo; in the veritable autograph of Messrs.
Moleskin and Corderoy could nowhere be discovered annexed to the
bills thereof: a slight upon their powers of penmanship which
roused their individual, collective, and coparcenary ires to such a
pitch, that they, Messrs. Moleskin and Corderoy, through the medium
of their Attorneys-at-law, Messrs. Gallowsworthy and Pickles, of
Furnival&rsquo;s Inn, forwarded a writ to the unfortunate Hannibal
Fitzflummery Fitzflam,&mdash;the which writ in process of time,
being the legal seed, became ripened into a very vigorous
execution, and was consigned to the care of a gentleman holding a
<em>Civil</em> employment with a <em>Military</em> title, viz. that
of &ldquo;<em>Officer</em>&rdquo; to the Sheriff of Middlesex, with
strict injunctions to the said&mdash;anything but <em>Civil</em> or
<em>Military</em>&mdash;nondescript &ldquo;officer,&rdquo; to
secure and keep the person of Hannibal Fitzflummery Fitzflam till
such time as the debt due to Messrs. Moleskin and Corderoy, and the
legal charges of Messrs. Gallowsworthy and Pickles, should be
discharged, defrayed, and liquidated.</p>
<p>Frequent were the meetings of Messrs. Gallowsworthy and Pickles
and their man-trap, and as frequent their
disappointments:&mdash;Fitzflam always gave them the double! Having
procured leave of absence from the Town Managers, and finding the
place rather too hot to hold him, he departed for the country, and,
as fate would have it, arrived at the inn then occupied by Mr.
Horatio Fitzharding Fitzfunk.</p>
<p>In this out-of-the-way place he fondly imagined he had never
been heard of. Judge then of his surprise, after his dinner and
pint of wine, at the following information.</p>
<p><em>Fitz.</em> &ldquo;Waiter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who have you in the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fust of company, sar;&mdash;alwaist, sar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! of course;&mdash;any one in particular?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sar, very particular: one gentleman very particular,
indeed. Has his bed warmed with brown sugar in the pan, and drinks
asses&rsquo; milk, sar, for breakfast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange fellow! but I mean any one of name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sar, a German, sar; with a name so long, sar, it
take all the indoor servants and a stable-helper to call him up of
a morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand me. Have you any public people
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sar&mdash;great man from town, sar&mdash;belongs to
the Theatre&mdash;Mr. Fitzflam, sar&mdash;quite the gentleman,
sar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for the compliment&rdquo; (<em>bowing
low</em>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;No compliment at all, sar; would you like to see him,
sar?&mdash;sell you a ticket, sar; or buy one of you,
sar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;House expected to be full, sar&mdash;sure to sell it
again, sar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The play, sar&mdash;Fitzflam, sar!&mdash;there&rsquo;s
the bill, sar, and (<em>bell rings</em>) there&rsquo;s the bell,
sar. Coming.&rdquo; (<em>Exit Waiter</em>.)</p>
<p>The first thing that suggested itself to the mind of Mr.
Hannibal Fitzflummery Fitzflam was the absolute necessity of
insisting upon that insane waiter&rsquo;s submitting to the total
loss of his well-greased locks, and enveloping his outward man in
an extra-strong strait-waistcoat; the next was to look at the bill,
and there he saw&mdash;&ldquo;horror of horrors!&rdquo;&mdash;the
name, &ldquo;the bright ancestral name&rdquo;&mdash;the name he
bore, bursting forth in all the reckless impudence of the largest
type and the reddest vermilion!</p>
<p>Anger, rage, and indignation, like so many candidates for the
exalted mutton on a greased pole, rushed tumultuously over each
other&rsquo;s heads, each anxious to gain the
&ldquo;ascendant&rdquo; in the bosom of Mr. Hannibal Fitzflummery
Fitzflam. To reduce a six-and-ninepenny gossamer to the fac-simile
of a bereaved muffin in mourning by one vigorous blow wherewith he
secured it on his head, grasp his ample cane and three half-sucked
oranges (in case it should come to pelting), and rush to the
theatre, was the work of just twelve minutes and a half. In another
brief moment, payment having been tendered and accepted, Fitzflam
was in the boxes, ready to expose the swindle and the swindler!</p>
<p>The first act was over, and the audience were discussing the
merits of the supposed Roscius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <em>is</em> a sweet young man,&rdquo; said a simpering
damsel to a red-headed Lothario, with just brains enough to be
jealous, and spirit enough to damn the player.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; responded he of the Rufusian
locks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such <em>dear</em> legs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Dear</em> legs&mdash;<em>duck</em> legs you mean,
miss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <em>such</em> a voice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Voice! I&rsquo;ll holler with him for all he&rsquo;s
worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha&rsquo; done, do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t:
Fitzflam&rsquo;s&mdash;an&mdash;umbug!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Hannibal Fitzflummery Fitz of
&ldquo;that ilk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Sir to you!&rdquo; retorted &ldquo;the child of earth
with the golden hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;m a right to speak my mind of that or
any other chap I pays to laugh at!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tragedy, James.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the funnier when sich as him comes to play in
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! the curtain&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;&mdash;So it was; and
&ldquo;Bravo! bravo!&rdquo; shouted the ladies, and
&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted the gentlemen. Never had Mr. Hannibal
Fitzflummery Fitzflam seen such wretched acting, or heard such
enthusiastic applause. Round followed round, until, worked up to
frenzy at the libel upon his name, and, as he thought, his art, he
vociferously exclaimed, &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, that
man&rsquo;s a d&mdash;d impostor! (&ldquo;Turn him out! throw him
over! break his neck!&rdquo; shouted the gods. &ldquo;Shame
shame!&rdquo; called the boxes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re drunk,&rdquo;
exclaimed the pit to a man.) I repeat that man
is&mdash;(&ldquo;<em>Take that</em>!&rdquo;&mdash;an apple in
Fitzflam&rsquo;s eye.) I say he is another (&ldquo;There it
is!&rdquo;&mdash;in his other eye) person
altogether&mdash;a&mdash;(&ldquo;Boxkeeper!&rdquo;) Nothing of the
sort; a&mdash;(&ldquo;Constable!&rdquo;) I&rsquo;ll
take&mdash;(&ldquo;Take that fellow out!&rdquo;) Allow me to
be&mdash;(&ldquo;Off! off!&rdquo;) I am&mdash;(&ldquo;&lsquo;Out!
out!&rdquo;) Let me request.&mdash;(&ldquo;Order!
order!&mdash;hiss! hiss!&mdash;oh! oh!&mdash;ah! ah!&mdash;phit!
phit!&mdash;Booh!&mdash;booh!&mdash;wooh!&mdash;oh!&mdash;ah!&rdquo;)&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Mr. Fitzfunk came forward, and commenced bowing like a
mandarin, while the gentleman who had blacked Fitzflam&rsquo;s eye
desisted from forcing him out of the box, to hear the &ldquo;great
creature&rdquo; speak. Fitzfunk commenced, &ldquo;Ahem&mdash;Ladies
and gentlemen, surrounded as I am by all sorts of&mdash;(Bravos
from all parts of the house.) Friends! Friends in the
boxes!&mdash;(&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; from boxes, with violent waving
of handkerchiefs.) Friends in the pit!&mdash;(&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;
and sundry excited hats performing extraordinary aerial gyrations.)
And last, not least in my dear love, friends in the
gallery!&mdash;(Raptures of applause; five minutes&rsquo;
whistling; three chandeliers and two heads broken; and the owners
of seventeen corns <em>stamped</em> up to frenzy!) Need I fear the
malice of an individual? (&ldquo;Never! never!&rdquo; from all
parts of the house.) Could I deceive you, an enlightened public?
(&ldquo;No! no! impossible! all fudge!&rdquo;) Would I attempt such
a thing? (&ldquo;No! no! by no manner of means!&rdquo;) I am,
ladies and gentlemen&mdash;(&ldquo;Fitzflam! Fitzflam!&rdquo;) I
bow to your judgment. I have witnesses; shall I produce
them?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said two of his most enthusiastic
supporters, scrambling out of the pit, and getting on the stage;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself; we know you; (<em>Omnes</em>.
&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; To Fitzflam in boxes&mdash;&ldquo;Shame!
shame!&rdquo;) <em>we</em> will swear to you; (<em>Omnes</em>,
&rdquo; Fitzflam for ever!&rdquo;) and&mdash;we don&rsquo;t care
who knows it&mdash;(<em>Omnes</em>. &ldquo;Noble fellows!&rdquo;)
we arrest you at the suit of Messrs. Moleskin and Corderoy,
Regent&rsquo;s-quadrant, tailors. Attorneys, Messrs. Gallowsworthy
and Pickles, of Furnival&rsquo;s Inn. Plaintiff claims
54<em>l.</em> debt and 65<em>l.</em> costs; so come along, will
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was an exceedingly fortunate thing for the representatives of
the Sheriff of Middlesex that their exit was marked by more
expedition than elegance; for as soon as their real purpose was
known, Fitzflam (as the audience supposed Fitzfunk to be) would
have been rescued <em>vi et armis</em>. As it was, they hurried him
to a back room at the inn, and carefully double-locked the door. It
was also rather singular that from the moment of the
officer&rsquo;s appearance, the gentleman in the boxes whose doubts
had caused the disturbance immediately owned himself in the wrong,
apologised for his mistake, and withdrew. As the tragedy could not
proceed without Fitzfunk, the manager proposed a
hornpipe-in-fetters and general dance by the characters; instead of
the last act which was accepted, and loudly applauded and encored
by the audience.</p>
<p>Seated in his melancholy apartment, well guarded by the bailiff,
certain of being discovered and perhaps punished as an impostor, or
compelled to part with all his earnings to pay for coats and
continuations he had never worn, the luckless Horatio Fitzharding
Fitzfunk gave way to deep despondency, and various
&ldquo;ahs!&rdquo; and &ldquo;ohs!&rdquo; A tap at the door was
followed by the introduction of a three-cornered note addressed to
himself. The following were its contents:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;It appears from this night&rsquo;s adventure
<em>my name</em> has heretofore been useful to you, and on the
present occasion your impersonation of it has been useful to me. We
are thus far quits. <em>I</em>, as the &lsquo;real Simon
Pure,&rsquo; will tell you what to do. Protest you <em>are not the
man</em>. Get witnesses to hear you say so; and when taken to
London (as you will be) and the men are undeceived, threaten to
bring an action against the Sheriff unless those harpies, Messrs.
Gallowsworthy and Pickles, give you 20<em>l.</em> for yourself, and
a receipt in full for the debt and costs. Keep my secret;
I&rsquo;ll keep yours. Burn this.&mdash;H.F.F.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner read than done; and all came to pass as the note
predicted. Gallowsworthy and Pickles grumbled, but were compelled
to pay. Fitzflam and Fitzfunk became inseparable. Fitzflam was even
heard to say, he thought in time Fitzfunk would make a decent
walking gentleman; and Fitzfunk was always impressed with an
opinion that <em>he</em> was the man of talent, and that Fitzflam
would never have been able to succeed in &ldquo;starring it&rdquo;
where he had been &ldquo;<em>The Great Creature</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="rgt">FUSBOS.</p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;The author of this paper has commenced adapting it
for stage representation.</p>

<h3>THE DESIRE OF PLEASING.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;May I be married, ma?&rdquo; said a lovely girl of
fifteen to her mother the other morning. &ldquo;Married!&rdquo;
exclaimed the astonished matron; &ldquo;what put such an idea into
your head?&rdquo; &ldquo;Little Emily, here, has never seen a
wedding; and I&rsquo;d like to amuse the child,&rdquo; replied the
obliging sister, with fascinating <em>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</em>.</p>

<h2>THE HEIR OF APPLEBITE.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
<div class="dropcap"><a href="images/016-01.png"><img src=
"images/016-01.png" alt=
"A street sweeper forms a letter A together with his broom." id=
"img016-01" name="img016-01" width="100%" /></a></div>
<p><span class="hide">A</span> serious accident to the double-bass
was the extraordinary occurrence alluded to in our last chapter. It
appeared that, contrary to the <em>usual</em> custom of the class
of musicians that attend evening parties, the operator upon the
double-bass had early in the evening shown slight symptoms of
inebriety, which were alarmingly increased during supper-time by a
liberal consumption of wine, ale, gin, and other compounds. The
harp, flageolet, and first violin, had prudently abstained from
drinking&mdash;at their own expense, and had reserved their
thirstiness for the benefit of the bibicals of the &ldquo;founder
of the feast,&rdquo; and, consequently, had only attained that
peculiar state of sapient freshness which invariably characterises
quadrille bands after supper, and had, therefore, overlooked the
rapid obfuscation of their more imprudent companion in their
earnest consideration of themselves.</p>
<p>Bacchus has long been acknowledged to be the cicerone of Cupid;
and accordingly the God of Wine introduced the God of Love into the
bosom of the double-bass, who, with a commendable feeling of
sociality, instantly invited the cook to join the party. Now Susan,
though a staid woman, and weighing, moreover, sixteen stone, was
fond of a &ldquo;hinnocent bit of nonsense,&rdquo; kindly consented
to take just a &ldquo;sip of red port wine&rdquo; with the
performer upon catgut cables; and everything was progressing
<em>allegro</em>, when Cupid wickedly stimulated the double-bass to
chuck Susan&rsquo;s double chin, and then, with the frenzy of a
Bacchanal, to attempt the impossibility of encircling the ample
waist of his Dulcinea. This was carrying the joke a <em>leetle</em>
too far, and Susan, equally alarmed for her reputation and her
habit-shirt, struggled to free herself from the embrace of the
votary of Apollo; but the fiddler was not to be so easily disposed
of, and he clung to the object of his admiration with such
pertinacity that Susan was compelled to redouble her exertions,
which were ultimately successful in embedding the double-bass in
the body of his instrument. The crash was frightful, and Susan,
having vainly endeavoured to free herself from the incubus which
had fastened upon her, proceeded to scream most lustily as an
overture to a faint. These sounds reached the supper-room, and
occasioned the diversion in John&rsquo;s favour; a simultaneous
rush was instantly made to the quarter from whence they proceeded,
as the whole range of accidents and offences flashed across the
imaginations of the affrighted revellers.</p>
<p>Mrs. Waddledot decided that the china tea-service was no more.
Mrs. Applebite felt certain that &ldquo;the heir&rdquo; had tumbled
into the tea-urn, or had cut another tooth very suddenly. The
gentlemen were assured that a foray had taken place upon the hats
and cloaks below, and that cabs would be at a premium and colds at
a discount. The ladies made various applications of the rest of the
catalogue; whilst old John wound up the matter by the consolatory
announcement that he &ldquo;know&rsquo;d the fire hadn&rsquo;t been
put out by the <em>in</em>gines in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The general alarm was, however, converted into general laughter
when the real state of affairs was ascertained; and Susan having
been recovered by burning feathers under her nose, and pouring
brandy down her throat, preparations were made for the disinterment
of the double-bass. To all attempts to effect such a laudable
purpose, the said double-bass offered the most violent opposition,
declaring he should never be so happy again, and earnestly
entreated Susan to share his heart and temporary residence.</p>
<p>Her refusal of both seemed to cause him momentary uneasiness,
for hanging his head upon his breast he murmured out&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Now she has left me her loss to deplore;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and then burst into a loud huzza that rendered some suggestions
about the police necessary, which Mr. Double-bass treated with a
contempt truly royal. He then seemed to be impressed with an idea
that he was the index to a &ldquo;Little Warbler;&rdquo; for at the
request of no one he proceeded to announce the titles of all the
popular songs from the time of Shield downwards. How long he would
have continued this vocal category is uncertain; but as exertion
seemed rather to increase than diminish his boisterous merriment,
the suggestions respecting the police were ordered to be adopted,
and accordingly two of the force were requested to remove him from
the domicile where he was creating so much discord in lieu of
harmony.</p>
<p>Double-bass still continued deaf to all entreaties for silence
and progression, and when a stretcher was mentioned grew positively
furious, and insisted that, as he had a conveyance of his own, he
should be taken to whatever destination they chose to select for
him on, or rather in, that vehicle. Accordingly a rattle was
sprung, and duly answered by two or three more of those
alphabetical gentlemen who emanate from Scotland-yard, by whose
united efforts the refractory musician was carried out in triumph,
firmly and safely seated in his own ponderous instrument, loudly
insisting that he should be conveyed</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/016-02.png"><img src=
"images/016-02.png" alt="A fellow sits on an upturned boat." id=
"img016-02" name="img016-02" width="50%" /></a>
<p>WITH CARE&mdash;THIS SIDE UP.</p>
</div>
<p>The interruption occasioned by this interesting occurrence was
productive of a general clearance of 24, Pleasant-place; and the
apartments which were so lately filled with airy sylphs and trussed
Adonises presented a strange jumble of rough coats, dingy silk
cloaks, very <em>pass&eacute;</em> bonnets, and numerous heads
enveloped in faded white handkerchiefs. Everything began to look
miserable; candles were seen in all directions flickering with
their inevitable destiny; bouquets were thrown carelessly upon the
ground; and the very faintest odour of a cigar found its way from
the street-door into the drawing-room. Then came the hubbub of
struggling jarvies; the hoarse, continued inquiries of those
peculiar beings that emerge from some unknown quarter of the great
metropolis, and &ldquo;live and move and have their being&rdquo; at
the doorsteps of party-giving people. What tales could those
benighted creatures tell of secret pressures of hands, whispered
sentences of sweet words, which have led in after-days to many a
blissful union! What sighs must have fallen upon their ears as they
have rolled up the steps and slammed to the doors of the vehicle
which bore away the idol of the evening! But they have no
romance&mdash;no ambition but to call &ldquo;My lord duke&rsquo;s
coach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came the desolate stillness of the &ldquo;banquet-hall
deserted;&rdquo; the consciousness that the hour of grandeur had
passed away. There was nothing to break the stillness but Mrs.
Applebite counting up the spoons, and Mrs. Waddledot re-decanting
the remainders.</p>

<p><span class="hide">M</span>y aunt, Mrs. Cheeseman, is the very
reverse of her husband. He is a plain, honest creature, such as we
read of in full-length descriptions by some folks, but equally
comprehensive, though shortly done by others, under the simple name
of John Bull&mdash;as ungarnished in his dress, as in his speech
and action; whereas Mrs. Cheeseman, as I have just told you, is the
counterpart of plainness; she has trinkets out of number, brooches,
backed with every kind of hair, from &ldquo;the flaxen-headed
cow-boy&rdquo; to the deep-toned &ldquo;Jim Crow.&rdquo; Then her
rings&mdash;they <em>are</em> the surprise of her staring
acquaintances; she has them from the most delicate Oriental fabric
to the massiveness of dog&rsquo;s collars.</p>
<p>Uncle Cheeseman says Mrs. C. thinks of nothing else; no sporting
gentleman, handsomely furnished, in the golden days of pugilism,
ever looked upon a ring with more delightful emotions. At going to
bed, she bestows the same affectionate gaze upon them that mothers
do upon their slumbering progeny; nor is that care and affection
diminished in the morning: her very imagination is a ring, seeing
that it has neither beginning nor end&mdash;her tender ideas are
encircled by the four magical letters R&mdash;I&mdash;N&mdash;G.
Even at church, we are told, she divides her time between sleeping
and secret polishing. It has just occurred to me, that I might have
saved you and myself much trouble had I at once told you that aunt
Cheeseman is a regular <em>Ring-worm</em>.</p>
<p>But, to my uncle&mdash;the only finery sported by him (and I
hardly think it deserving that word), besides a silver watch, sound
and true as the owner, and the very prototype of his bulk and
serenity, was a gold snuff-box, a large and handsome one, which he
did not esteem for its intrinsic weight; he had a &ldquo;lusty
pride&rdquo; in showing that it was a prize gained in some skilful
agricultural contest. I am sorry at not recollecting what was
engraven on it; but being a thorough Cockney, and knowing nothing
more of the plough and harrow than that I have somewhere observed
it as a tavern sign, must plead for my ignorance in
out-o&rsquo;-town matters.</p>
<p>You can remember, no doubt, the day the Queen went to dine with
the City Nabobs at Guildhall. Cheeseman hurried impatiently to
London for the sole purpose of <em>seeing</em> the sight, and upon
finding my liking for the spectacle as powerful as his own,
declared I was the only sensible child my mother ever had, and
adding that as he was well able to push his way through a Lunnon
crowd, if my father and mother were willing, under his protection I
should see this grand affair. Not the slightest objection was put
in opposition to my uncle&rsquo;s proposal, consequently the next
day, November the 9th, 1837, uncle Cheeseman and I formed integral
portions of the huge mass of spectators which reached from St.
James&rsquo;s to the City.</p>
<p>After slipping off the pavement a score of times (and in some
instances opportunely enough to be shoulder-grazed by a passing
coach-wheel), stunning numberless persons by explosions of oaths
for clumsy collisions and unintentional performances upon his
tenderest corn, we reached the corner of St. Paul&rsquo;s
churchyard.</p>
<p>Having secured by a two-shilling bargain about three feet of a
form, which, I suppose, upon any other day than a general holiday
like the present was the <em>locus in quo</em> for little dears
whose young ideas were taught to shoot at threepence a week, uncle
took breath, and a pinch of snuff together: he smiled as I
observed, that he&rsquo;d be sure to take a refresher when her
Majesty passed; and though he shook his head and designated me a
sly young rogue, I could clearly perceive that he was plotting to
perform, as if by chance, what I had predicated as a certainty; and
although nineteen persons out of twenty would have marked (in this
instance) his puerility, I doubt not but that the same number are
(at some periods of their existence) innocent victims to the like
weakness, whether it be generated in a snuff-box or a royal
diploma.</p>
<p>By-and-by, a murmur from the distance, which succeeded a
restless motion among the crowd (like a leafy agitation of trees
coming as a kind of <em>courier en avant</em> to announce the
regular hurricane), broke gradually, and at last uproariously upon
us; straining our necks and eyes in the attractive direction. Uncle
grasped me by the arm, and though he spoke not a word, he fairly
stared, &ldquo;Here it comes.&rdquo; Now the thick tide of the
moving portion of the spectators began to sweep past us, as they
hedged in the soldiery and carriages; then came the shouting,
accompanied by various kinds of squeezing, tearing, and stumbling;
some screaming compliments to her Majesty, and in the same breath
dispensing more violent compliments in an opposite direction, and
of a decidedly different tendency. Shoes were trodden off, and
bonnets crushed out of all fashion; coats were curtailed; samples
of their quality were either seen dangling at the heels of the
wearer, or were ignominiously trodden under foot; and many
superfine Saxony trousers were double-milled without mercy.</p>
<p>Whilst we were pluming ourselves upon the snugness of our
situations, and the attendant good fortune of being easy partners
in the business of the day, and thus freed from the vexations and
perplexities so largely distributed in our view, I was hindered
from communicating my happiness upon these points, for at this
moment down went my uncle Cheeseman, and as suddenly up flew his
arms above his head, like Boatswain Smith at the height of
exhortation on Tower Hill. I was surprised, and so appeared my
unfortunate relation, who superadded an additional mixture of
indignation as I caught a glimpse or two of his chameleon-like
visage; for at the first sight I could have most honestly sworn it
to have been white&mdash;at the second as crimson as the sudden
consciousness of helpless injury could make it. Nevertheless, he
sailed away from me in this extraordinary attitude for a short
distance, when suddenly, as he lowered his arms, I observed sundry
hands descend quickly, and, as I thought, kindly, lest he should
lose his hat, upon the crown of it, until it encased more of his
head than could be deemed either fashionable or comfortable.
Presently, however, he was again seen viciously elbowing and
writhing his way back to me, which after immense exertions he
performed, in the full receipt of numerous anathemas and jocular
insults. As he neared me, I inquired what he had been doing; why he
had left me for such a short, difficult, and unprofitable
journey&mdash;which queries, innocently playful as they were,
appeared to produce a choking sensation, accompanied by a
full-length stare at me; but his naturally kind heart was not kept
long closed against me, and I gleaned the melancholy fact from his
indignation, which was continually emitted in such short gusts as,
&ldquo;The villains&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The
scoundrels&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;And done so
suddenly&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The only thing I
prized,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, this is a lesson for me.&rdquo;
As we returned home, uncle displayed a wish to thrust himself
everywhere into the densest mass; there was a morbid carelessness
in his manner that he had hitherto never shown; he was evidently
another man, a fallen creature; his pride, his existence, the very
theme of all his joys, his gold snuff-box, had departed for ever,
and his heart was in that box: what would Mrs. Cheeseman say? He
had been cleaned out to the very letter&mdash;ay, that
letter&mdash;it perhaps contained matters of moment.</p>
<p>I have since that affair upon several occasions heard the poor
fellow declare that much as he was heart-broken at the loss of his
box, his feelings were lacerated to a greater degree when, in a
curtain lecture, my staid, correct, frosty-hearted, jewel-hugging
aunt said, &ldquo;Cheeseman, it was a judgment for such conduct to
a wife. In that letter, which you treated with such contumely, I
strictly cautioned you not to take that valuable box about with
you, if your madness for sight-seeing should lead you into a mob.
Let this be a warning to you; and be sure that though woman be the
weaker vessel, she is oftentimes the deepest.&rdquo; We believe
it.</p>

<h3>THE PENSIVE PEEL.</h3>
<p>It is an unfounded calumny of the enemies of Sir Robert Peel to
say that he has gone into the country to amuse
himself&mdash;shooting, feasting, eating, and drinking&mdash;while
the people are starving in the streets and highways. <em>We</em>
know that the heart of the compassionate <em>old rat</em> bleeds

living upon bread and water, and studying Lord John Russell&rsquo;s

<h2>NIGGER PECULIARITIES.</h2>
<p>Perhaps no race of people on the face of the habitable globe are
so strongly imbued with individual peculiarities as the free and
slave negro population of the United States. Out-heroding Herod in
their monstrous attempts of imitating and exceeding the fashions of
the whites, the emulative &ldquo;Darkies&rdquo; may be seen on
Sundays occupying the whole extent of the Broadway pavement,
dressed in fashions carried to the very sublime of the ridiculous.
Whatever is the order of the day, the highest <em>ton</em> among
the whites is instantly adopted, with the most ludicrous
exaggeration, by the blacks: if small brims be worn by the beaus of
the former, they degenerate to nothing on the skulls of the latter;
if width be the order of the day, the coloured gentlemen rush out
in unmeasurable umbrellas of felt, straw, and gossamer. A
long-tailed white is, in comparison, but a docked black. Should
muslin trip from a carriage, tucked or flounced to the knee, the
same material, sported by a sable belle, will take its next Sunday
out fur-belowed from hip to heel. Parasols are parachutes; sandals,
black bandages; large bonnets, straw sheds, and small ones,
nonentities. So it is with colours: green becomes more green, blue
more blue, orange more orange, and crimson more flaming, when
sported by these ebon slaves of deep-rooted vanity.</p>
<p>The spirit of imitation manifests itself in all their actions:
hence it is by no means an uncommon occurrence to see a tall,
round-shouldered, woolly-headed, buck-shinned, and
inky-complexioned &ldquo;Free Nigger,&rdquo; sauntering out on
Sunday, shading his huge weather-proof face from the rays of the
encroaching sun under a carefully-carried silk umbrella! And again,
as in many of the places of worship the whole congregation cannot
be accommodated with seats, many of the members supply their own;
so these sable gentry may be frequently seen progressing to church
with a small stool under their arms: and in one instance, rather
than be disappointed, or obliged to stand,&mdash;a solemn-looking
specimen of the species actually provided himself with a strong
brick-bat, and having carefully covered it with his many and
bright-coloured bandana, preserved his gravity, and, still more
strange, his balance, with an irresistible degree of mirth-creating
composure.</p>
<p>Their laziness and unequivocal antipathy to work is as true as
proverbial. We know an instance of it in which the master ordered
his sable &ldquo;help&rdquo; to carry a small box from the steam
pier to the Astor-House Hotel, where his newly-married wife, an
English lady, was waiting for it; judge of her surprise to see the
dark gentleman arrive followed by an Irish lad bearing the freight
intended for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dar,&rdquo; said the domineering conductor; &ldquo;dar,
dat will do; put da box down dar. Now, Missis, look here, jist give
dat chap a shillin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shilling! What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cos he bring up dar plunder from de bay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you bring it yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here. Somehow I rader guess I should ha let dar box
fall and smashiated de contents, so I jist give dat white trash de
job jest to let de poor crittur arn a shillin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remonstrance was vain, so the money was paid; the lady
declaring, for the future, should he think proper to employ a
deputy, it must be at his own expense. The above term &ldquo;white
trash&rdquo; is the one commonly employed to express their supreme
contempt for the &ldquo;low Irish wulgar set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their dissensions among themselves are irresistibly comic.
Threatening each other in the most outrageous manner; pouring out
invectives, anathemas, and denunciations of the most deadly nature;
but nine times in ten letting the strife end without a blow;
affording in their quarrels an apt illustration of</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tale full of sound and fury, Told by an idiot,
signifying nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suppose an affront, fancied or real, put by one on another, the
common commencement of ireful expostulations generally runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here! you d&mdash;m black nigger; what you do dat
for, Sar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoo you call black, Sar? D&mdash;m, as white as you, Sar;
any day, Sar. You nigger, Sar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here agin; don&rsquo;t you call me a nigger, Sar.
Now, don&rsquo;t you do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neber mind; I&rsquo;ve told you on it, so don&rsquo;t you
go to do it no more, you mighty low black, cos if you do put my
dander up, and make me wrasey, I rader guess I&rsquo;ll smash in
your nigger&rsquo;s head, like a bust-up egg-shell. Ise a
ring-tailed roarer, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon I&rsquo;m a Pottomus. Don&rsquo;t you go to put my
steam up; d&mdash;d if don&rsquo;t bust and scald you out.
I&rsquo;m nothing but a snorter&mdash;a pretty considerable
tarnation long team, and a couple of horses to spare; so jest be
quiet, I tell you, or I&rsquo;ll use you up uncommon
sharp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You use me up! Yoo, yoo! D&mdash;m! You and your wife and
some nigger children, all ob you, was sold for a hundred and fifty
dollars less than this nigger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, don&rsquo;t you say dat agin; don&rsquo;t you
do it; I tell you, don&rsquo;t you do it, or I&rsquo;ll jist give
you such an almighty everlasting shaking, dat you shall pray for a
cold ague as a holiday. I&rsquo;m worth considerable more dollars
dan sich a low black man as you is worth cents. Why, didn&rsquo;t
dey offer to give you away, only you such dam trash no one would
take you, so at last you was knocked down to a blind
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What dat? Here! Stand clear dar behind, and get out ob de
way in front, I&rsquo;m jist going to take a run and butt dat
nigger out of de State. Let me go, do you hear? Golly, if you
hadn&rsquo;t held me he&rsquo;d a been werry small pieces by dis
time. D&mdash;m, I&rsquo;ll break him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yoo, yoo! Your low buck-shins neber carry your black head
fast enough to catch dis elegant nigger. You jist run; you&rsquo;ll
find I&rsquo;m nothing but an alligator. You hab no more chance dan
a black slug under de wheels of a plunder-train carriage. You is
unnoticeable by dis gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dar dat good, gentleman! Golly, dat good! Look here,
don&rsquo;t you neber speak to me no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And look here, nigger, don&rsquo;t you neber speak to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you d&mdash;m fust, black man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you scorched fust, nigger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day, trash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good mornin, dirt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So generally ends the quarrel; but about half-an-hour afterwards
the Trash and Dirt will generally be found lauding each other to
the skies, and cementing a new six hours&rsquo; friendship over
some brandy punch or a mint julep.</p>

<h2>THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LONDON MEDICAL STUDENT.</h2>
<h3>5.&mdash;OF HIS MATURITY, AND LATIN EXAMINATION.</h3>
<p>The second season arrives, and our pupil becomes &ldquo;a
medical student&rdquo; in the fullest sense of the word. He has an
indistinct recollection that there are such things as wards in the
hospital as well as in a key or the city, and a vague wandering,
like the morning&rsquo;s impression of the dreams of the preceding
night, that in the remote dark ages of his career he took some
notes upon the various lectures, the which have long since been
converted into pipe-lights or small darts, which, twisted up and
propelled from between the forefingers of each hand, fly with
unerring aim across the theatre at the lecturer&rsquo;s head, the
slumbering student, or any other object worth aiming at&mdash;an
amusing way of beguiling the hour&rsquo;s lecture, and only
excelled by the sport produced, if he has the good luck to sit in a
sunbeam, from making a tournament of
&ldquo;Jack-o&rsquo;-lanthorns&rdquo; on the ceiling. His locker in
the lobby of the dissecting-room has long since been devoid of
apron, sleeves, scalpels, or forceps; but still it is not empty.
Its contents are composed of three bellpull-handles, a valuable
series of shutter-fastenings, two or three broken pipes, a pewter
&ldquo;go&rdquo; (which, if everybody had their own, would in all
probability belong to Mr. Evans, of Covent Garden Piazza), some
scraps of biscuit, and a round knocker, which forcibly recalls a
pleasant evening he once spent, with the accompanying anecdotes of
how he &ldquo;bilked the pike&rdquo; at Waterloo Bridge, and poor
Jones got &ldquo;jug&rsquo;d&rdquo; by mistake.</p>
<p>It must not, however, be supposed that the student now neglects
visiting the dissecting-room. On the contrary, he is unremitting in
his attendance, and sometimes the first there of a morning, more
especially when he has, to use his own expression, been
&ldquo;going it rather fast than otherwise&rdquo; the evening
before, and comes to the school very early in the morning to have a
good wash and refresh himself previously to snatching a little of
the slumber he has forgotten to take during the night, which he
enjoys very quietly in the injecting-room down stairs, amidst a
heterogeneous assemblage of pipkins, subjects, deal coffins,
sawdust, inflated stomachs, syringes, macerating tubs, and dried
preparations. The dissecting-room is also his favourite resort for
refreshment, and he broils sprats and red herrings on the
fire-shovel with consummate skill, amusing himself during the
process of his culinary arrangements by sawing the corners off the
stone mantel-piece, throwing cinders at the new man, or seeing how
long it takes to bore a hole through one of the stools with a
red-hot poker. Indeed, these luckless pieces of furniture are
always marked out by the student as the fittest objects on which to
wreak his destructive propensities; and he generally discovers that
the readiest way to do them up is to hop steeple-chases upon them
from one end of the room to the other&mdash;a sporting amusement
which shakes them to pieces, and irremediably dislocates all their
articulations, sooner than anything else. Of course these
pleasantries are only carried on in the absence of the
demonstrator. Should he be present, the industry of the student is
confined to poking the fire in the stove and then shutting the
flue, or keeping down the ball of the cistern by some abdominal
hooks, and then, before the invasion of smoke and water takes
place, quietly joining a knot of new men who are strenuously
endeavouring to dissect the brain and discover the <em>hippocampus
major</em>, which they expect to find in the perfect similitude of
a sea-horse, like the web-footed quadrupeds who paw the
&ldquo;reality&rdquo; in the &ldquo;area usually devoted to
illusion,&rdquo; or tank, at the Adelphi Theatre.</p>
<p>If one of the professors of his medical school chances to be
addicted to making anti-Martin experiments on animals, or the study
of comparative anatomy, the pursuits offer an endless fund of
amusement to the jocose student. He administers poison to the
toxicological guinea-pigs; hunts the rabbit kept for galvanism
about the school; lets loose in the theatre, by accident, the
sparrows preserved to show the rapidly fatal action of
<em>choke-damp</em> upon life; turns the bladders, which have been
provided to tie over bottles, into footballs; and makes daily
contributions to the plate of pebbles taken from the stomach of the
ostrich, and preserved in the museum to show the mode in which
these birds assist digestion, until he quadruples the quantity, and
has the quiet satisfaction of seeing exhibited at lecture, as the
identical objects, the heap of small stones which he has collected
from time to time in the garden of the school, or from any
excavation for pipes or paving which he may have passed in his
route from his lodgings.</p>
<p>The second or middle course of the three winter sessions which
the medical student is compelled to go through, is the one in which
he most enjoys himself, and indulges in those little outbreaks of
eccentric mirth which eminently qualify him for his future
professional career. During the first course he studies from
novelty&mdash;during the last from compulsion; but the middle one
passes in unlimited sprees and perpetual half-and-half. The only
grand project he now undertakes is &ldquo;going up for his
Latin,&rdquo; provided he had not courage to do so upon first
coming to London. For some weeks before this period he is never
seen without an interlined edition of Celsus and Gregory; not that
he debars himself from joviality during the time of his
preparation, but he judiciously combines study with
amusement&mdash;never stirring without his translation in his
pocket, and even, if he goes to the theatre, beguiling the time
between the pieces by learning the literal order of a new
paragraph. Every school possesses circulating copies of these
works: they have been originally purchased in some wild moment of
industrious extravagance by a new man; and when he passed, he sold
them for five shillings to another, who, in turn, disposed of them
to a third, until they had run nearly all through the school. The
student grinds away at these until he knows them almost by heart,
albeit his translation is not the most elegant. He
reads&mdash;&ldquo;<em>Sanus homo</em>, a sound man; <em>qui</em>,
who; <em>et</em>, also; <em>bene valet</em>, well is in health;
<em>et</em>, and; <em>su&aelig; spontis</em>, of his own choice;
<em>est</em>, is,&rdquo; &amp;c. This, however, is quite
sufficient; and, accordingly, one afternoon, in a rash moment, he
makes up his mind to &ldquo;go up.&rdquo; Arrived at
Apothecaries&rsquo; Hall&mdash;a building which he regards with a
feeling of awe far beyond the Bow-street Police Office&mdash;he
takes his place amongst the anxious throng, and is at last called
into a room, where two examiners politely request that he will
favour them by sitting down at a table adorned with severe-looking
inkstands, long pens, formal sheets of foolscap, and awfully-sized
copies of the light entertaining works mentioned above. One of the
aforesaid examiners then takes a pinch of snuff, coughs, blows his
nose, points out a paragraph for the student to translate, and
leaves him to do it. He has, with a prudent forethought, stuffed
his cribs inside his double-breasted waistcoat, but, unfortunately,
he finds he cannot use them; so when he sticks at a queer word he
writes it on his blotting-paper and shoves it quietly on to the
next man. If his neighbour is a brick, he returns an answer; but if
he is not, our friend is compelled to take shots of the meaning and
trust to chance&mdash;a good plan when you are not certain what to
do, either at billiards or Apothecaries&rsquo; Hall. Should he be
fortunate enough to get through, his schedule is endorsed with some
hieroglyphics explanatory of the auspicious event; and, in
gratitude, he asks a few friends to his lodgings that night, who
have legions of sausages for supper, and drink gin-and-water until
three o&rsquo;clock in the morning. It is not, however, absolutely
necessary that a man should go up himself to pass his Latin. We
knew a student once who, by a little judicious change of
appearance&mdash;first letting his hair grow very long, and then
cutting it quite short&mdash;at one time patronizing whiskers, and
at another shaving himself perfectly clean&mdash;now wearing
spectacles, and now speaking through his nose&mdash;being, withal,
an excellent scholar, passed a Latin examination for half the men
in the hospital he belonged to, receiving from them, when he had
succeeded, the fee which, in most cases, they would have paid a
private teacher for preparing them.</p>
<p>The medical student does not like dining alone; he is
gregarious, and attaches himself to some dining-rooms in the
vicinity of his school, where, in addition to the usual journals,
they take in the Lancet and Medical Gazette for his express
reading. He is here the customer most looked up to by the
proprietor, and is also on excellent terms with
&ldquo;Harriet,&rdquo; who confidentially tells him that the boiled
beef is just up; indeed, he has been seen now and then to put his
arm round her waist and ask her when she meant to marry him, which
question Harriet is not very well prepared to answer, as all the
second season men have proposed to her successively, and each
stands equally well in her estimation, which is kept up at the rate
of a penny <em>per diem</em>. But Harriet is not the only waiting
domestic with whom he is upon friendly terms. The Toms, Charleses,
and Henrys of the supper-taverns enjoy equal familiarity; and when
Nancy, at Knight&rsquo;s, brings him oysters for two and asks him
for the money to get the stout, he throws down the shilling with an
expression of endearment that plainly intimates he does not mean to
take back the fourpence change out of the pot. Should he, however,
in the course of his wanderings, go into a strange eating-house,
where he is not known, and consequently is not paid becoming
attention, his revenge is called into play, and he gratifies it by
the simple act of pouring the vinegar into the pepper-castor, and
emptying the contents of the salt-cellar into the water-bottle
before he gets up to walk away.</p>

<h2>POLITICS OF THE OUTWARD MAN!</h2>
<p>Wisdom is to be purchased only of the tailor. Morality is
synonymous with millinery; whilst Truth herself&mdash;pictured by
the poetry of the olden day in angelic nakedness&mdash;must now be
full-dressed, like a young lady at a royal drawing-room, to be
considered presentable. You may believe that a man with a gash in
his heart may still walk, talk, pay taxes, and perform all the
other duties of a highly civilised citizen; but to believe that the
same man with a hole in his coat can discourse like a reasoning
animal, is to be profoundly ignorant of those sympathetic
subtleties existing between a man&rsquo;s brain and a man&rsquo;s
broad-cloth. Party politics have developed this profound
truth&mdash;the divine reason of the immortal creature escapes
through ragged raiment; a fractured skull is not so fatal to the
powers of ratiocination as a rent in the nether garments.
GOD&rsquo;S image loses the divine lustre of its origin with its
nap of super-Saxony. The sinful lapse of ADAM has thrown all his
unfortunate children upon the mercies of the tailor; and that
mortal shows least of the original stain who wraps about it the
richest purple and the finest linen. Hence, if you would know the
value of a man&rsquo;s heart, look at his waistcoat.</p>
<p>Philosophers and anatomists have quarrelled for centuries as to
the residence of the soul. Some have vowed that it lived
here&mdash;some there; some that, like a gentleman with several
writs in pursuit of him, it continually changed its lodgings;
whilst others have lustily sworn that the soul was a vagrant, with
no claim to any place of settlement whatever. Nevertheless, a
vulgar notion has obtained that the soul dwelt on a little knob of
the brain; and that there, like a vainglorious bantam-cock on a
dunghill, it now claps its wings and crows all sorts of
triumph&mdash;and now, silent and scratching, it thinks of nought
but wheat and barley. The first step to knowledge is to confess to
a late ignorance. We avow, then, our late benighted condition. We
were of the number of sciolists who lodged the soul in the head of
man: we are now convinced that the true dwelling place of the soul
is in the head&rsquo;s antipodes. Let SOLOMON himself return to the
earth, and hold forth at a political meeting; SOLOMON himself would
be hooted, laughed at, voted an ass, a nincompoop, if SOLOMON spoke
from the platform with a hole in his breeches!</p>
<p>PLATO doubtless thought that he had imagined a magnificent
theory, when he averred that every man had within him a spark of
the divine flame. But, silly PLATO! he never considered how easily
this spark might be blown out. At this moment, how many Englishmen
are walking about the land utterly extinguished! Had men been made
on the principle of the safety-lamp, they might have defied the
foul breath of the world&rsquo;s opinion&mdash;but, alas! what a
tender, thin-skinned, shivering thing is man! His
covering&mdash;the livery of original sin, bought with the pilfered
apples&mdash;is worn into a hole, and Opinion, that sour-breathed
hag, claps her blue lips to the broken web, gives a puff,
and&mdash;out goes man&rsquo;s immortal spark! From this moment the
creature is but a carcase: he can eat and drink (when lucky enough
to be able to try the experiment), talk, walk, and no more; yes, we
forgot&mdash;he can work; he still keeps precedence of the ape in
the scale of creation&mdash;for he can work for those who, thickly
clothed, and buttoned to the throat, have no rent in their purple,
no stitch dropped in their superfine, to expose their precious
souls to an annihilating gust, and who therefore keep their
immortal sparks like tapers in burglars&rsquo; dark-lanthorns,
whereby to rob and spoil with greater certainty!</p>
<p>Gentle reader, think you this a fantastic chapter on holes? If
so, then of a surety you do not read those instructive annals of
your country penned by many a TACITUS of the daily press&mdash;by
many a profound historian who unites to the lighter graces of
stenography the enduring loveliness of philosophy.</p>
<p>Some days since a meeting was held in the parish of Saint
Pancras of the &ldquo;Young Men&rsquo;s Anti-Monopoly
Association.&rdquo; The place of gathering, says the reporter, was
&ldquo;a ruined <em>penny</em> theatre!&rdquo; It is evident in the
brain of the writer that the small price at which the theatre was
ruined made its infamy: to be blighted for a penny was the shame.
Drury Lane and Covent Garden have been ruined over and over
again&mdash;but then their ruin, like PHRYNE&rsquo;S, has ever been
at a large price of admission; hence, like court harlots, their
ruin has been dignified by high remuneration. What, however, could
be expected from a theatre that, with inconceivable wickedness,
suffered itself to be undone for a penny? Let the reporter
answer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash; FORSTER, Esq., advanced, and, assuming
<em>a teapot position</em> on the stage, moved the first
resolution, to the effect &lsquo;That the bread-tax was the cause
of all distress, and that they should use their strenuous efforts
to remove it.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ladies (there was one old woman <em>in
a shocking bad black and white straw bonnet present</em>) and
gentlemen (said he), this is a public meeting to all intents and
purposes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For ourselves we care not for an orator&rsquo;s standing like a
teapot, if what he pours out be something better than mere
hot-water or dead small beer. If, however, we were to typify
orators in delf, there are many Tory talkers whom we would
associate with more ignominious shapes of crockery than that of a
teapot&mdash;senators who are taken by the handle, and by their
party used for the dirtiest offices.</p>
<p>We now come to the bad old woman whose excess of iniquity was
blazoned in her &ldquo;bad black and white straw bonnet.&rdquo;
This woman might have been an ASPASIA, a DE STAEL, a Mrs.
SOMERVILLE,&mdash;nay, the SYBILLA CUMEA herself. What of that? The
&ldquo;bad&rdquo; bonnet must sink the large souled Grecian to a
cinder-wench, make the Frenchwoman a trapes from the Palais Royal,
our fair astronomer a gipsy of Greenwich Park, and the
fate-foretelling sybil a crone crawled from the worst garret of
Battle-bridge. The head is nothing; the bonnet&rsquo;s all. Think
you that Mrs. Somerville could have studied herself into
reputation, that the moon and stars would have condescended to
smile upon her, if she had not attended their evening parties in a
handsome turban, duly plumed and jewelled?</p>
<p>Come we now to the next recorded atrocity:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There jumped now upon the stage <em>a red-haired,
laughing-hyena faced, fustian-coated biped</em>,
exclaiming&mdash;&lsquo;My name is Wall! I have a substantive
amendment to move to the resolution now proposed&mdash;(&lsquo;Go
off, off! ooh, ooh, ooh! turn him out, out, out!&rsquo;) We are met
in a place where religion is taught (groans). Well, then, we are
met where they &ldquo;teach the young idea how to
shoot&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;(laughter, groans, and &lsquo;Go on,
Wall.&rsquo;) Turning to the young <em>gents</em> on the platform,
&lsquo;You,&rsquo; quoth Mr. Wall, &lsquo;have not read history:
you clerks at 16<em>s.</em> a week, with your gold chains and
pins.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Red hair was first made infamous by JUDAS ISCARIOT; hence the
reporter not only shows the intensity of his Christianity, but his
delicate knowledge of human character, by the fine contempt cast
upon the felon locks of the speaker. Red hair is doubtless the
brand of Providence; the mark set upon guilty man to give note and
warning to his unsuspicious fellow-creatures. Like the scarlet
light at the North Foreland, it speaks of shoals, and sands, and
flats. The emperor Commodus, who had all his previous life rejoiced
in flaxen locks, woke, the morning after his first contest in the
arena, a red-haired man! But then, with a fine knowledge of the
wholesome prejudices of the world, he turned the curse upon his
head into a beauty; for he&mdash;powdered it with gold-dust. Could
Mr. WALL, of the penny theatre, induce the Master of the Mint to
play his <em>coiffeur</em>, how would the reporter fall on his
knees and worship the divinity!</p>
<p>Mr. WALL, being of the opposite faction, in addition to the
unpowdered ignominy of his hair, has also the face of a hyena! This
fact opens a question too vast for our one solitary page. We lack
at least the amplitude of a quarto to prove that all men are
fashioned, even in the womb, with features that shall hereafter
beautifully harmonise with the politics of the grown creature. Now
WALL, being ordained a poor man and a Chartist, is endowed with a
&ldquo;laughing hyena&rdquo; countenance. He even loses the vantage
ground of our common humanity, and is sunk by his poverty and his
politics to the condition of a beast, and of a most unamiable beast
into the bargain. However, the vast enfolding iniquity is yet to be
displayed and duly shuddered at; for <em>WALL</em>, the biped
hyena, wears&mdash;a fustian coat!</p>
<p>As journalists, we trust we have our common share&mdash;which is
no little&mdash;of human vanity. Nevertheless, with the highest
private opinion of our own powers, we feel we can add nothing to
the picture drawn by the reporter. The fustian coat, with a tongue
in every button-hole, discourses on its own inwoven infamy.</p>
<p>We recognise with great pleasure a growing custom on the part of
political reporters to merge the orators and listeners at public
meetings in their several articles of dress. This practice has
doubtless originated in a most philosophical consideration of the
sympathies between the outer and the inner man, and has its source
in the earliest records of human life. The patriarchs rent their
garments in token of the misery that lacerated their souls: then
rags and tatters were ennobled by sorrow&mdash;there was a deep
sentiment in sackcloth and ashes. We have, however, improved upon
the ignorance of primitive days; and though we still admit the
covering of man to be typical of his condition of mind, we wisely
keep our respect for super-Saxony, and expend contempt and ridicule
on corduroy and fustian. We yet hope to see the day when certain
political meetings will be briefly reported as follow:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Faded Blue Coat, with tarnished Brass Buttons, took the
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Velveteen Jacket moved the first resolution, which was
seconded by Check Shirt and Ankle-jacks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brown Great Coat, with holes in elbows, moved the second
resolution&mdash;seconded by Greasy Drab Breeches and Dirty Leather
Gaiters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After thanks to Blue Coat had been moved by Brown Surtout
and Crack under both Arms, the Fustian Jackets departed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would not this be quite sufficient? Knowing the philosophy of
appearance in England, might we not by our imagination supply a
truer speech to every orator than could be taken down by the most
faithful reporter?</p>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S REVIEW.</h2>
<h3>THE MEMOIRS OF MADAME LAFFARGE.</h3>
<div class="note">
<p>The title, I think, will strike. The fashion, you know, now, is
to do away with old prejudices, and to rescue certain characters
from the illiberal odium with which custom has marked them. Thus we
have a generous Israelite, an amiable cynic, and so on. Now, Sir, I
call my play&mdash;<em>The Humane Footpad</em>.&mdash;SYLVESTER
DAGGERWOOD.</p>
</div>
<p>Some four or five seasons since, the eccentric Buckstone
produced a three-act farce, which, by dint of its after
title&mdash;<em>The School for Sympathy</em>&mdash;and of much
highly comic woe, exhibited in the acting of Farren and Nisbett,
was presented to uproariously-affected audiences during some score
nights. The hinge of the mirth was made to turn upon the
irresistible drollery of one man&rsquo;s running away with another
man&rsquo;s wife, and the outrageous fun of the consequent suicide
of the injured husband; the <em>bons mots</em> being most
tragically humorous, and the aphorisms of the several characters
facetiously concatenative of the nouns contained in the leading
name of the piece&mdash;&ldquo;<em>Love</em> and
<em>Murder</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now this was a magnificent idea&mdash;one of those brilliant
efforts which cannot but tend to lift the theatre in the estimation
of every man of delicacy and education. A new source of attraction
was at once discovered,&mdash;a vast fund of available fuel was
suddenly found to recruit the cinerulent embers of the drama
withal. It became evident that, after Joe Miller, the ordinary of
Newgate was the funniest dog in the world. Manslaughter, arson, and
the more practical jokes in the Calendar, were already familiar to
the stage; it was a refinement of the Haymarket authors to
introduce those livelier sallies of wit&mdash;crim. con. and
felo-de-se. The &ldquo;immense coalitions&rdquo; of all manner of
crimes and vices in the subsequent &ldquo;highway
school&rdquo;&mdash;the gradual development of every unnatural
tendency in the youthful Jack Sheppard (another immor-t-al work by
the author of the afore-lauded comedy)&mdash;the celebration, by a
classic chaunt, of his reaching the pinnacle of depravity; this was
the <em>ne plus ultra</em> of dramatic invention. Robbers and
murderers began to be treated, after the Catholic fashion, with
extreme unction; audiences were intoxicated with the new drop;
sympathy became epidemic; everybody was bewildered and improved;
and nobody went and threw themselves off the Monument with a copy
of the baleful drama in his pocket!</p>
<p>But the magnificence of the discovery was too large to be
grasped by even the gluttonous eye of the managers, The Adelphi
might overflow&mdash;the Surrey might quake with reiterated
&ldquo;pitsfull&rdquo;&mdash;still there remained over and above
the feast-crumbs sufficient for the battenings of other than
theatrical appetites. Immediately the press-gang&mdash;we beg
pardon, the <em>press</em>&mdash;arose, and with a mighty throe
spawned many monsters. Great drama! <em>Greater Press!</em>
GREATEST PUBLIC!</p>
<p>Now this was all excellent well as far as it went; but still
there was something wanted of more reality than the improvisations
of a romancist. Ainsworth might dip his pen in the grossest
epithets; Boz might dabble in the mysterious dens of Hebrew
iniquity; even Bulwer might hash up to us his recollections of St.
Giles&rsquo;s dialogue; and yet it was evident that they were all
the while only &ldquo;shamming&rdquo;&mdash;only cooking up some
dainty dish according to a <em>recipe</em>, or, as it is still
frequently pronounced, a <em>receipt</em>,&mdash;which last, with
such writers, will ever be the guide-post of their track.</p>
<p>But something more was wanted; and here it is&mdash;here, in the
Memoirs of Marie Cappelle.</p>
<p>This lady, perhaps the most remarkable woman of her age, has
published a book&mdash;half farce, half novel&mdash;in which she
treats by turns with the clap-trap agony of a Bulwer, the quaint
sneer of a Dickens, and the effrontery of an Ainsworth, that
serious charge which employed the careful investigation of the most
experienced men in France for many weeks, and which excited a
degree of interest in domestic England almost unexampled in the
history of foreign trials. This work is published by a gentleman
who calls himself &ldquo;Publisher in ordinary to her
Majesty,&rdquo; and may be procured at any book-seller&rsquo;s by
all such as have a guinea and a day&rsquo;s leisure at the mercy of
the literary charlatan who contrived it.</p>
<p>In the strictest confidence we would suggest, that if a treaty
could be ratified with Madame Marie Cappelle Laffarge, we do not
doubt that our nursery&mdash;yea, our laundry&mdash;maids would
learn to spell the precious sentences, to their own great
edification and that of the children placed under their charge.</p>
<hr />
<h3>OUR TRADE REPORT.</h3>
<p>Coals are a shade blacker than they were last week, but not
quite so heavy; and turnips are much lighter than they have been
known for a very considerable period.</p>
<p>Great complaints are made of the ticketing system; and persons
going to purchase shawls, as they supposed, at nine-pence
three-farthings each, are disgusted at being referred to a very
small one pound sixteen marked very lightly in pencil immediately
before the 9&frac34;<em>d.</em>, which is very large and in very
black ink. There were several transactions of this kind during the
whole morning.</p>
<p>The depressed state of the Gossamer-market has long been a
subject of conversation among the four-and-niners who frequent the
cheap coffee-shops in the City; but no one knows the cause of what
has taken place, nor can they exactly state what the occurrence is
that they are so loudly complaining of.</p>
<p>Bones continue to fetch a penny for two pounds; but great
murmurs are heard of the difficulty of making up a pound equal to
the very liberal weights which the marine-store keepers use when
making their <em>purchases</em>; they, however, make up for it by
using much lighter weights when they sell, which is so far fair and
satisfactory.</p>
<p>The arrivals in baked potatoes have been very numerous; fifty
cans were entered outwards on Saturday.</p>
<hr />
<h3>RELATIVE GENTILITY.</h3>
<p>Two ladies of St. Giles&rsquo;s disputing lately on the
respectability of each other&rsquo;s family, concluded the debate
in the following way:&mdash;&ldquo;Mrs. Doyle, ma&rsquo;am,
I&rsquo;d have you know that I&rsquo;ve an uncle a
<em>bannister</em> of the law.&rdquo; &ldquo;Much about your
<em>bannister</em>,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Doyle;
&ldquo;haven&rsquo;t I a first cousin a <em>corridor</em> in the
navy?&rdquo;</p>

<h3>KEEPING IT DARK.</h3>

<h2>THE GENTLEMAN&rsquo;S OWN BOOK.</h2>
<p>REVENONS A NOS MOUTONS&mdash;i.e. (for the benefit of country
members) to return to our mutton, or rather the
&ldquo;trimmings.&rdquo; The ornaments which notify the pecuniary
superiority of the wearer include chains, rings, studs, canes,
watches, and purses. <em>Chains</em> should be of gold, and cannot
be too ostentatiously displayed; for a proper disposition of these
&ldquo;braveries&rdquo; is sure to induce the utmost confidence in
the highly useful occupants of Pigot&rsquo;s and Robson&rsquo;s
Directory. We have seen some waistcoats so elaborately festooned,
that we would stake our inkstand that the most unbelieving
money-lender would have taken the personal security of the wearer
without hesitation. The perfection to which mosaic-work has arrived
may possibly hold out a strong temptation to the thoughtless to
substitute the shadow for the reality. Do not deceive yourself; an
experienced eye will instantly detect the imposition, though your
ornaments may be</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/016-08.png"><img src=

"A bald man in a frilly shirt applies carmine to his cheeks." id=
"img016-08" name="img016-08" width="50%" /></a>
<p>FRESH EVERY DAY;</p>
</div>
<p>for, we will defy any true gentleman to preserve an equanimity
of expression under the hint&mdash;either visual or
verbal&mdash;that (to use the language of the poet) you are
&ldquo;a man of brass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have a faint recollection of a class of gentlemen who used to
attach an heterogeneal collection of massive seals and keys to one
end of a chain, and a small church-clock to the other. The chain
then formed a pendulum in front of their small-clothes, and the
dignified oscillation of the appendages was considered to
distinguish the gentleman. They were also used as auxiliaries in
argument; for whenever an hiatus occurred in the discussion, the
speaker, by having resort to his watch-chain, could frequently
confound his adversary by commencing a series of rapid gyrations.
But the fashion has descended to merchants, lawyers, doctors,
<em>et sui generis</em>, who never drive bargains, ruin debtors,
kill patients, <em>et cetera</em>, without having recourse to this
imposing decoration.</p>
<p><em>Rings</em> are the next indicators of superfluous cash. As
they are <em>merely ornamental</em>, they should resemble vipers,
tapeworms, snakes, toads, monkey&rsquo;s, death&rsquo;s heads, and
similar engaging and pleasing subjects. The more liberally the
fingers are enriched, the greater the assurance that the hand is
never employed in any useful labour, and is consequently only
devoted to the minisitration of indulgences, and the exhibition of
those elegant productions which distinguish the highly-civilised
gentleman from the <em>highly-tattooed</em> savage.</p>
<p>Mourning-rings have an air of extreme respectability; for they
are always suggestive of a legacy, and of the fact that you have
been connected with somebody who was not buried at the expense of
the parish.</p>
<p><em>Studs</em> should be selected with the greatest possible
care, and in our opinion the small gold ones can only be worn by a
perfect gentleman; for whilst they perform their required office,
they do not distract the attention from the quality and whiteness
of your linen. Some that we have seen were evidently intended for
cabinet pictures, rifle targets and breast-plates.</p>
<p><em>Pins.</em>&mdash;These necessary adjuncts to the cravat of a
gentleman have undergone a singular revolution during late years;
but we confess we are admirers of the present fashion, for if it is
desirable to indulge in an ornament, it is equally desirable that
everybody should be gratified by the exhibition thereof. We presume
that it is with this commendable feeling that pins&rsquo;-heads
(whose smallness in former days became a proverb) should now
resemble the apex of a beadle&rsquo;s staff; and, as though to make
&ldquo;assurance doubly sure,&rdquo; a plurality is absolutely
required for the decoration of a gentleman. In these times, when
political partisanship is so exceedingly violent, why not make the
pins indicative of the opinions of the wearer, as the waistcoat was
in the days of Fox. We could suggest some very appropriate designs;
for instance, the heads of Peel and Wakley, connected by a
<em>very</em> slight link&mdash;Sibthorp and Peter Borthwick by a
series of long-car rings&mdash;Muntz and D&rsquo;Israeli cut out of
very hard wood, and united by a hair-chain; and many others too
numerous to mention.</p>

<h2>THE MAN OF HABIT.</h2>
<p>I meet with men of this character very frequently, and though I
believe that the stiff formality of the past age was more congenial
than the present to the formation and growth of these peculiar
beings, there are still a sufficient number of the species in
existence for the philosophical cosmopolite to study and comment
upon.</p>
<p>A true specimen of a <em>man of habit</em> should be an old
bachelor,&mdash;for matrimony deranges the whole clock-work system
upon which he piques himself. He could never endure to have his
breakfast delayed for one second to indulge &ldquo;his soul&rsquo;s
far dearer part&rdquo; with a prolonged morning dream; and he
dislikes children, because the noisy urchins make a point of
tormenting him wherever he goes. The Man of Habit has a certain
hour for all the occupations of his life; he allows himself twenty
minutes for shaving and dressing; fifteen for breakfasting, in
which time he eats two slices of toast, drinks two cups of coffee,
and swallows two eggs boiled for two and a half minutes by an
infallible chronometer. After breakfast he reads the newspaper, but
lays it down in the very heart and pith of a clever article on his
own side of the question, the moment his time is up. He has even
been known to leave the theatre at the very moment of the
<em>d&eacute;nouement</em> of a deeply-interesting play rather than
exceed his limited hour by five minutes. He will be out of temper
all day, if he does not find his hat on its proper nail and his
cane in its allotted corner. He chooses a particular walk, where he
may take his prescribed number of turns without interruption, for
he would prefer suffering a serious inconvenience rather than be
obliged to quicken or slacken his pace to suit the speed of a
friend who might join him. My uncle Simon was a character of this
cast. I could take it on my conscience to assert that, every night
for the forty years preceding his death, he had one foot in the bed
on the first stroke of 11 o&rsquo;clock, and just as the last chime
had tolled, that he was enveloped in the blankets to his chin. I
have known him discharge a servant because his slippers were placed
by his bed-side for contrary feet; and I have won a wager by
betting that he would turn the corner of a certain street at
precisely three minutes before ten in the morning. My uncle used to
frequent a club in the City, of which he had become the oracle.
Precisely at eight o&rsquo;clock he entered the room&mdash;took his
seat in a leather-backed easy chair in a particular
corner&mdash;read a certain favourite journal&mdash;drank two
glasses of rum toddy&mdash;smoked four pipes&mdash;and was always
in the act of putting his right arm into the sleeve of his
great-coat, to return home, as the clock struck ten. The cause of
my uncle&rsquo;s death was as singular as his life was whimsical.
He went one night to the club, and was surprised to find his seat
occupied by a tall dark-browed man, who smoked a
<em>meerschaum</em> of prodigious size in solemn silence. Numerous
hints were thrown out to the stranger that the seat had by
prescriptive right and ancient custom become the property of my
uncle; he either did not or would not understand them, and
continued to keep his possession of the leather-backed chair with
the most imperturbable <em>sang-froid</em>. My uncle in despair
took another seat, and endeavoured to appear as if nothing had
occurred to disturb him,&mdash;but he could not dissimulate. He was
pierced to the heart,&mdash;and</p>

<p>&ldquo;I SAW THE IRON ENTER HIS SOLE.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>My uncle left the club half-an-hour before his time; he returned
home&mdash;went to bed without winding his watch&mdash;and the next
morning he was found lifeless in his bed.</p>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S POLITICAL ECONOMY.</h2>
<p>The subject of political economy is becoming so general a
portion of education, that it will doubtless soon be introduced at
the infant schools among the other eccentric evolutions or playful
whirls of <em>Mr. Wilder-spin</em>. At it is the fashion to
comprehend nothing, but to have a smattering of everything, we beg
leave to smatter our readers with a very thin layer of political
economy. In the first place, &ldquo;political&rdquo; means
&ldquo;political,&rdquo; and &ldquo;economy&rdquo; signifies
&ldquo;economy,&rdquo; at least when taken separately; but put them
together, and they express all kinds of extravagance. Political
economy contemplates the possibility of labouring without work,
eating without food, and living without the means of subsistence.
Social, or individual economy, teaches to live <em>within</em> our
means; political economy calls upon us to live <em>without</em>
them. In the debates, when more than usual time has been wasted in
talking the most <em>extravagant</em> stuff, ten to one that there
has been a good deal of <em>political economy</em>. If you bother a
poor devil who is dying of want, and speak to him about
<em>consumption</em>, it is probably &ldquo;political
economy&rdquo; that you will have addressed to him. If you talk to
a man sinking with hunger about <em>floating</em> capital, you will
no doubt have given him the benefit of a few hints in
&ldquo;political economy:&rdquo; while, if to a wretch in tattered
rags you broach the theory of <em>rent</em>, he must be an
ungrateful beast indeed if he does not appreciate the blessings of
&ldquo;political economy.&rdquo; That &ldquo;labour is
wealth&rdquo; forms one of the most refreshing axioms of this
delicious science; and if brought to the notice of a man breaking
stones on the road, he would perhaps wonder where his wealth might
be while thinking of his labour, but he could not question your
proficiency in &ldquo;political economy.&rdquo; In fact, it is the
most political and most economical science in the world, if it can
only be made to achieve its object, which is to persuade the
hard-working classes that they are the richest people in the
universe, for their labour gives value, and value gives wealth; but
who gets the value and the wealth is a consideration that does not
fall within the province of &ldquo;political economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is another branch of the subject at which we shall merely
glance; but one hint will open up a wide field of observation to
the student. The branch to which we allude is the tremendous extent
to which political economy is carried by those who interfere so
much in politics with so very little political knowledge, and who
consequently display a most surprising share of &ldquo;political
economy,&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a very little goes a great way, and particularly as the most
diminutive portion of knowledge communicated by ourselves is, like
the &ldquo;one small pill constituting a dose,&rdquo; much more
efficacious than the 40 Number Ones and 50 Number Twos of the mere
quacks, we close for the present our observations on <em>Political
Economy</em>.</p>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S THEATRE.</h2>
<h3>THE MAID OF HONOUR.</h3>
<p>The Adelphi &ldquo;Correspondent from Paris&rdquo; has favoured
that Theatre with an adaptation of Scribe&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>Verre
d&rsquo;Eau</em>,&rdquo; which he has called &ldquo;The Maid of
Honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody must remember that, last year, the trifling affair of
the British Government was settled by the far more momentous
consideration of who should be Ladies of the Bed-chamber. The
Parisians, seeing the dramatic capabilities of this incident, put
it into a farce, resting the whole affair upon the shoulders of a
former Queen whose Court was similarly circumstanced. This is the
piece which Mr. Yates has had the daring to get done into English,
and transplanted into Spain, and interspersed with embroidery,
confectionary, and a Spanish sentence; the last judiciously
entrusted to that accomplished linguist, Mr. John Saunders.</p>
<p>Soon after the rising of the curtain, we behold the figure of
Mr. Yates displayed to great advantage in the dress usually
assigned to <em>Noodle</em> and <em>Doodle</em> in the tragedy of
&ldquo;Tom Thumb.&rdquo; He represents the <em>Count
Ollivarez</em>, and the head of a political party&mdash;the
opposition. The Court faction having for its chief the <em>Duchess
of Albafurez</em>, who being Mistress of the Queen&rsquo;s robes is
of course her favourite; for the millinery department of the
country which can boast of a Queen Regnant is of far higher
importance than foreign or financial affairs, justice, police, or
war&mdash;consequently, the chief of the wardrobe is far more
exalted and better beloved than a mere Premier or Secretary of
State. The Count is planning an intrigue, the agents of which are
to be <em>Henrico</em>, a Court page, and <em>Felicia</em>, a court
milliner. Not being able to make much of the page, he turns over a
new leaf, and addresses himself to the dress-maker; so, after a few
preliminary hems, he draws out the thread of his purpose to her,
and cuts out an excellent pattern for her guidance, which if she
implicitly follow will assuredly make her a Maid of Honour.</p>
<p>A comedy without mystery is Punch without a joke; Yates without
a speech to the audience on a first night; or Bartley&rsquo;s
pathos without a pocket-handkerchief. The Court page soon opens the
book of <em>imbroglio</em>. He is made a Captain of the
Queen&rsquo;s Guard by some unknown hand; he has always been
protected by the same unseen benefactor, who, as if to guard him
from every ill that flesh is heir to, showers on him his or her
favours upon condition that he never marries! &ldquo;Happy
man,&rdquo; exclaims the Count. &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; answers
the other, &ldquo;I am in love with <em>Felicia</em>!&rdquo; Nobody
is surprised at this, for it is a rule amongst dramatists never to
forbid the banns until the banned, poor devil, is on the steps of
the altar. <em>Henrico</em>, now a Captain, goes off to flesh his
sword; meets with an insult, and by the greatest good luck kills
his antagonist in the precincts of the palace; so that if he be not
hanged for murder, his fortune is made. The victim is the
Count&rsquo;s cousin, to whom he is next of kin. &ldquo;Good
Heavens!&rdquo; ejaculates <em>Ollivarez</em>, &ldquo;You have made
yourself a criminal, and me&mdash;a Duke! Horrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the way, this same <em>Henrico</em>, as performed by that
excellent swimmer (in the water-piece), Mr. Spencer Forde, forms a
very entertaining character. His imperturbable calmness while
uttering the heart-stirring words, assigned by the author to his
own description of the late affair-of-honourable assassination, was
highly edifying to the philosophic mind. The pleasing and amiable
tones in which he stated how irretrievably he was ruined, the
dulcet sweetness of the farewell to his heart&rsquo;s adored, the
mathematical exactitude of his position while embracing her, the
cool deliberation which marked his exit&mdash;offered a picture of
calm stoicism just on the point of tumbling over the precipice of
destruction not to be equalled&mdash;not, at least, since those
halcyon dramatic days when Osbaldiston leased Covent Garden, and
played <em>Pierre</em>.</p>
<p>Somehow or other&mdash;for one must not be too particular about
the wherefores of stage political intrigues&mdash;<em>Felicia</em>
is promoted from the office of making dresses for the Queen to that
of putting them on. Behold her a maid of honour and of all-work;
for the Queen takes her into her confidence, and in that case
people at Court have an immense variety of duties to perform. The
Duchess&rsquo;s place is fast becoming a sinecure, and she trembles
for her influence&mdash;perhaps, in case of dismissal, for her next
quarter&rsquo;s salary to boot&mdash;so she shakes in her
shoes.</p>
<p>It is at this stage of the plot that we perceive why the part of
<em>Henrico</em> was entrusted to the gentleman who plays
it,&mdash;the mystery we have alluded to being by this arrangement
very considerably increased; for we now learn that no fewer than
three ladies in the piece are in love with him, namely,
<em>Felicia</em>, the Queen, and the Duchess. Now the most
penetrating auditor would never, until actually informed of the
fact, for a moment suspect a Queen, or even a Duchess, of such bad
taste; for, as far as our experience goes, we have generally found
that women do not cast their affections to men who are sheepish,
insensible, cold, ungainly, with small voices, and not more than
five feet high. Surprise artfully excited and cleverly satisfied is
the grand aim of the dramatist. How completely is it here
fulfilled! for when we discover that the personator of Henrico is
meant for an Adonis, we <em>are</em> astonished.</p>
<p>The truth is then, that the secret benefactor of this
supposed-to-be irresistible youth has always been the <em>Duchess
Albafurez</em>, who, learning from <em>Ollivarez</em> that her pet
has new claims upon her heart for having killed her friend the
Duke, determines to assist him to escape, which however is not at
all necessary, for Ollivarez is entrusted with the warrant for
apprehending the person or persons unknown who did the murder. But
could he injure the man who has made him a Duke by a lucky
<em>coup-d&rsquo;&eacute;p&eacute;e</em>? No, no. Let him cross the
frontier; and, when he is out of reach, what thundering
denunciations will not the possessor of the dukedom fulminate
against the killer of his cousin! It is shocking to perceive how
intimately acquainted old Scribe must be with manners, customs, and
feelings, as they exist at Court.</p>
<p>The necessary passports are placed before the Queen for her
signature (perhaps her Spanish Majesty can&rsquo;t afford clerks);
but when she perceives whom they threaten to banish from behind her
chair, she declines honouring them with her autograph. The Duchess
thus learns her secret. &ldquo;She, too, love Henrico? Well I
never!&rdquo; About this time a tornado of jealousy may be
expected; but court etiquette prevents it from bursting; and the
Duchess reserves her revenge, the Queen sits down to her embroidery
frame, and one is puzzled to know what is coming next.</p>
<p>This puzzle was not on Monday night long in being resolved.
<em>Ollivarez</em> entered, and a child in the gallery commenced
crying with that persevering quality of tone which threatens long
endurance. Mr. Yates could not resist the temptation; and
Ollivarez, the newly-created Duke of Medina, promised the baby a
free admission for four, any other night, if it would only vacate
the gallery just then. These terms having been assented to by a
final screech, the infant left the gallery. After an
instant&rsquo;s pause&mdash;during which the Manager tapped his
forehead, as much as to say, &ldquo;Where did I leave
off?&rdquo;&mdash;the piece went on.</p>
<p>We had no idea till last night how difficult it was for a Queen
to indulge in a bit of flirtation! A most elaborate intrigue is, it
seems, necessary to procure for her a tender interview with her
innamorato. A plan was invented, whose intricacy would have
bothered the inventor of spinning-jennies, whereby <em>Henrico</em>
was to be closeted with her most Christian Majesty,&mdash;its grand
accomplishment to take place when the Queen called for a glass of
ice (the original <em>Scribe</em> wrote &ldquo;water,&rdquo; but
the Adelphi adapter thought ice would be more natural, for fear the
piece should run till Christmas). The Duchess overhears the entire
plot, but fails in frustrating it. Hence we find <em>Henrico,
Felicia</em>, and the Queen together, going through a
well-contrived and charmingly-conducted scene of
equivoque&mdash;the Queen questioning <em>Henrico</em> touching the
state of his heart, and he answering her in reference to
<em>Felicia</em>, who is leaning over the embroidery frame behind
the Queen, and out of her sight.</p>
<p>This felicitous situation is interrupted by the spiteful
Duchess; the lover escapes behind the window curtains to avoid
scandal&mdash;is discovered, and his sovereign&rsquo;s reputation
is only saved by the declaration of Felicia, that the Captain is
there on <em>her</em> account. Ollivarez asserts that they are
married, to clench the fib&mdash;the Queen sees her folly&mdash;the
Duchess is disgraced&mdash;all the characters stand in the
well-defined semicircle which is the stage method of writing the
word &ldquo;finis&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Yates speaks a very neat and
pointed &ldquo;tag&rdquo;&mdash;and that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>For this two-act Comidetta, dear Yates, we pronounce absolution
and remission of thy sins, so wickedly committed in the washy
melo-drama, and cackling vaudeville, thou hast recently affronted
common-sense withal! Thine own acting as the courtier was natural,
except when thou didst interpolate the dialogue with the
baby&mdash;a crying sin, believe us. Else, thy bows were graceful;
and thy shoulder-shrugs&mdash;are they not chronicled in the
mind&rsquo;s eye of thy most distant admirers? The little touches
of humour that shone forth in the dialogue assigned to thee, were
not exaggerated by the too-oft-indulged-in grimaces&mdash;in short,
despite thy too monstrous <em>chapeau-bras</em>&mdash;which was big
enough for a life-boat&mdash;thou lookedst like a Duke, a
gentleman, and what in truth thou really art&mdash;an indefatigable
<em>intriguant</em>. Thy favoured help-mate, too, gave a reality to
the scene by her captivating union of queenly dignity and feminine
tenderness. But most especially fortunate art thou in thy Felicia.
Alas for our hunch and our hatchet nose! but O, alas! and alas!
that we have a Judy! for never did we regret all three so deeply as
while Miss Ellen Chaplin was on the stage. In our favourite scene
with the Queen and her lover, how graceful and expressive were her
dumb answers to what ought to have been Henrico&rsquo;s eloquent
declarations, spoken <em>through</em> the Queen. We charge thee,
dear friend, to &ldquo;call&rdquo; her on Monday morning at eleven,
and to rehearse unto her what we are going to say. Tell her that as
she is young, a bright career is before her if she will not fall
into the sin of copying some other favourite actress&mdash;say, for
instance, Mrs. Yates&mdash;instead of our arch-mistress, Nature;
say, moreover, that at the same time, she must be unwearying in
acquiring <em>art</em>; lastly, inform her, that Punch has his eye
upon her, and will scold her if she become a backslider and an
imitator of other people&rsquo;s faults.</p>
<p>As to poor Mr. <em>Spencer</em> Forde, he, too, is young; and
you do wrong, O Yates! in giving him a part he will be unequal to
till he grows big enough for a coat. A smaller part would, we doubt
not, suit him excellently.</p>
<p>Lastly, give our best compliments to Mrs. Fosbroke, to the
illustrious Mr. Freeborn, to Mr. John Saunders, and our especial
commendations to thy scene-painter, thy upholsterer, and the
gentleman lamp-lighter thou art so justly proud of; for each did
his and her best to add a charm to &ldquo;The Maid of
Honour.&rdquo;</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
